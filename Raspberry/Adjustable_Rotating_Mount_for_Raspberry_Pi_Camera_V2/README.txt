# Summary

I made this mount to attach the Raspberry Pi Camera V2 on my 3D printer for OctoPrint.
My printer is made of acrylic sheet as an Ultimaker. You can use double-sided adhesive tape or some glue to attach the mount to the printer.

This mount is rotating on 2 axis so you can orient the camera!

If you printed it, please click on "I made one" and upload a photo!
